# ECES450650-Tutorial7: Reviewing how to use a metagenomic assembler and the metrics involved in assessing its performance. 
Goal: compare metrics in the assembler, such as N50, aberage contigs' size, etc. using Quast (https://kbase.us/applist/apps/kb_quast/run_QUAST_app/release)

## Tool: 
KBase (https://kbase.us/n/33233/351/)
Assembly and annotation documentation: https://docs.kbase.us/apps/analysis/assembly-and-annotation

## Dataset: 
/ifs/groups/eces450650Grp/data/CAMI_low_RL_S001__insert_270_GoldStandardAssembly.fasta.gz from Picotte
